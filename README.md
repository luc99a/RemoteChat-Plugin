RemoteChat-Plugin
=================

Bukkit plugin that makes your server's chat accessible from anywhere

With this plugin you will be able to make chat messages from your website. I also provade a simple PHP API to do this, very simple
to use, just take a look at it in the PHPApi folder. You just need to upload RemoteChatAPI.class.php on your website, include it
using PHP when you wish, and to send messages use the code in connect.php modified to fit for your server
